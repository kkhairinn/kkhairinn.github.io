      <li><b>Story:</b>  Moving to Penang and becoming the "new girl" at school was a big step for me. It was my first time starting over somewhere new, and I worried constantly about whether Iâ€™d make friends or end up alone. Despite being introverted and shy about starting conversations, I knew I had to step out of my comfort zone to adapt and connect with people. I pushed myself to be more open and find good friends, helping me settle into my new school environment.</li><br>
      <li><b>Emotion:</b> On my first day, I was really nervous of being new girl and can't stop overthinking it</li>
